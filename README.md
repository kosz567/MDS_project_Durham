# MDS_project_Durham

The replication materials for my MDS project on the use of moral language in parliamentary discussion on China 1988-2023 are all avaliable here. Some of the documents (namely the excel documents containing the textual data), were too large to upload to the repository directly hence, a link to my google drive is provided here where these can be accessed and downloaded as .csv files in order to run the full code properly. 

This is the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1yVMDYEG4crsHSEg-cCThQVewnNU0x-UP
