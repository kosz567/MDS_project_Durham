# MDS_project_Durham

The replication materials for my MDS project on the use of moral language in parliamentary discussion on China 1988-2023 are all avaliable here. Some of the documents (namely the excel documents containing the textual data), were too large to upload to the repository directly hence, a link to my google drive is provided here. The additional documents can be access through the link where and downloaded as .csv files in order to run the full code properly. 

This is the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1yVMDYEG4crsHSEg-cCThQVewnNU0x-UP
